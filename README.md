------------

Since I am extreemly lazy I am not going to offer support. Well maybe every once n a while. This project is an Eclipse workspace folder, so it should be pretty easy for someone to import it into Eclipse and make fixes or changes to the software.

Sites running this software:

http://www.hiive.biz


### Update API
------------

The update API was designed to mimic the dyndns2 protocol in order to make it compatible most DDNS clients. Once the Dynamic DNS Server is installed and running the API is avaialble. To access the API you will need credentials from the web application in order to use the API's Http Basic Authentication.
