If Your conduct fails to conform to the terms and conditions of this AUP in a fashion that negatively impacts Hiive or its systems or networks, or such that continued provision of the Services violates the law, Hiive may immediately suspend the Services and/or any Order.

<h2>7. Changes to this Policy.</h2>

Your continued use of the Services constitutes an acknowledgement of the terms of the then current AUP and an agreement to follow and be bound by the same. <br /><br /> The following constitutes Hiive's Account Ownership, Access Recovery and Service Separation Policy for Hiive Services. If you (a "Customer") no longer have access to your Hiive account for Hiive Services (referred to herein simply as an "Account"), or your Account has been terminated, please follow the instructions below to regain access to your Hiive Services, or create a new Account. <br /><br /> Please note: For privacy and security reasons, Hiive does not discuss account ownership or recovery matters over the phone or social media. Please contact our Billing Team at billing@hiive.biz for assistance with account access recovery.</p>
<h2>8. Account Ownership.</h2>
<p>The creator of every Account on an Hiive owned and operated website offering Hiive Services must, in accordance with Hiive's Acceptable Use Policy for Hiive Services (the "AUP"), provide a contact email address at which Hiive may contact him/her (the "Authoritative Contact Email Address"). Before any account is activated, Hiive will send an email to the Authoritative Contact Email Address with a link that the prospective account owner must click through to confirm that the account associated with the Authoritative Contact Email Address should be activated. <br /><br /> The person or entity that controls the Authoritative Contact Email Address is considered the "Account Owner."</p>
<h2>9. Account Access Recovery.</h2>
<p>The following methods describe the proper procedures for regaining access to Accounts and related Hiive Services:</p>
<h2>10. Password Reset</h2>
<p>All Account owners may use the Reset Password Form to regain access to their Account. An Account owner may enter either their username or Authoritative Contact Email Address into the form. A confirmation email will be delivered to the Authoritative Contact Email Address, allowing the Account owner to change their password and log in with new credentials. This is the primary means of Account recovery in all circumstances.</p>
<h2>11. "Expired" Accounts.</h2>
<p>Free accounts are subject to inactivity expiration. If an Account Owner does not log into the account within a rolling thirty (30) day period, the account and its services are subject to deletion from the Hiive database. Free accounts cannot and will not be restored by the Hiive Billing Team. In the event of a "lost/expired" account, Customers may create a new account by following the steps found here.</p>
<h2>12. Account Deletion for Invalid Email Addresses.</h2>
<p>The AUP requires Customers to maintain a valid Authoritative Contact Email Address at all times. If the Authoritative Contact Email Address is no longer valid (returns 500-level error code from the responsible mail server, e.g. 550 User Unknown, Message Undeliverable, Delivery Failure, etc.), Hiive may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Account and any associated services for noncompliance. Upon deletion, Accounts and any associated Hiiveamic DNS hostnames are returned to the pool of available account and service names, allowing Customers to potentially recreate them. Hiive shall have no liability in the event a Customer is unable to recreate an Account, access an Account, or access a Dynamic DNS hostname that was used prior to such termination, expiration or deletion.</p></body>
